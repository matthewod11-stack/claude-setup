# Spec Review Request

You are reviewing a technical specification document from the perspective of code architecture and IDE navigation. Your task is to provide feedback on how this will translate into actual code organization.

## Document to Review

{{SPEC_CONTENT}}

---

## Your Review Focus

Focus especially on:
- File and folder structure recommendations - Where should code live?
- Module boundaries and organization - How should functionality be grouped?
- IDE navigation experience - How will developers find and explore this code?
- Import/export patterns - How should modules connect?
- Code colocation - What should be kept together vs separated?

## Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

### 1. Proposed Directory Structure
[Recommended folder/file organization]

```
project/
├── suggested/
│   └── structure/
```

### 2. Module Boundaries
[How to split functionality into modules]

### 3. Interface Recommendations
[What should be exported from each module?]

### 4. Navigation Patterns
[How will developers find related code?]

### 5. Dependency Flow
[How should imports/dependencies be structured?]

### 6. Top 3 Architectural Concerns
[The most critical structural issues to address]

Think about how someone would navigate this codebase in an IDE. Make it discoverable.
