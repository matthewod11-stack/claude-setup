# Spec Review Request

You are reviewing a technical specification document. Your task is to provide critical feedback that will improve the spec before implementation begins.

## Document to Review

{{SPEC_CONTENT}}

---

## Your Review Focus

Focus especially on:
- Implementation feasibility - Can this actually be built as described?
- API design patterns - Are interfaces clean and consistent?
- Code structure recommendations - How should this be organized?
- Developer experience - Will this be pleasant to work with?
- Practical tradeoffs - What compromises should be considered?

## Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

### 1. Feasibility Assessment
[Can this be built? What's hard? What's easy?]

### 2. API & Interface Design
[How should public interfaces be designed?]

### 3. Implementation Recommendations
[Specific code organization suggestions]

### 4. Developer Experience Concerns
[What will be painful to use or maintain?]

### 5. Practical Tradeoffs
[What should be simplified or deferred?]

### 6. Top 3 Priority Items
[The most critical issues to address]

Be direct and actionable. Focus on what would actually cause problems during implementation.
