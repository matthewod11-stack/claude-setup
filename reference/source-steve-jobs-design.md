## The 13 Principles

### 1. "How can I make this simpler?"
Jobs' obsession distilled. Strips away everything unnecessary.
> "I'm building a course with 47 modules. How can I make this simpler?"
> Result: 5 modules that actually matter

### 2. "What would this look like if I started from zero?"
Breaks out of incremental thinking.
> "I've been tweaking my resume for years. What would this look like if I started from zero?"

### 3. "What's the one thing this absolutely must do perfectly?"
Focus over features.
> "My app has 20 features but users are confused. What's the one thing this absolutely must do perfectly?"

### 4. "How would I design this for someone who's never seen it before?"
Beginner's mind—eliminates insider assumptions.
> "I'm explaining my business to investors. How would I design this for someone who's never seen it before?"

### 5. "What would the most elegant solution be?"
Aesthetic obsession as problem-solving.
> "I have a complex workflow with 15 steps. What would the most elegant solution be?"

### 6. "Where am I adding complexity that users don't value?"
Anti-feature thinking—spots over-engineering.
> "My website has tons of options but low conversions. Where am I adding complexity that users don't value?"

### 7. "What would this be like if it just worked magically?"
Designs invisible interfaces.
> "Users struggle with our onboarding process. What would this be like if it just worked magically?"

### 8. "How would I make this insanely great instead of just good?"
Pushes past acceptable.
> "My presentation is solid but boring. How would I make this insanely great instead of just good?"

### 9. "What am I including because I can, not because I should?"
Discipline over capability—restraint coach.
> "I can add 10 more features to my product. What am I including because I can, not because I should?"

### 10. "How can I make the complex appear simple?"
Jobs' magic trick—finds accessible entry point.
> "I need to explain AI to executives. How can I make the complex appear simple?"

### 11. "What would this look like if I designed it for myself?"
Personal use case first—cuts through market research.
> "I'm building a productivity app. What would this look like if I designed it for myself?"

### 12. "Where am I compromising that I shouldn't be?"
Never settle—spots quality blind spots.
> "I'm launching a 'good enough' version. Where am I compromising that I shouldn't be?"

### 13. "How can I make this feel inevitable instead of complicated?"
Natural user flow thinking.
> "My sales process has 12 touchpoints. How can I make this feel inevitable instead of complicated?"
