# Spec Interview Prompt

**Core Prompt:**

Read this `@SPEC.md` and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file.
